# ej2-showcase-aspnetmvc-expense-tracker

This application pulls data from an SQL Server Database and populates graphs and charts. Used a SyncFusion template for the webpage, but created own charts and graphs using SyncFusion software. Needs to be connected to a local database in order for the application to work. The application was made for data that was provided by a brazillian e-commerce website called OList and showed particular details such as how many orders from which state, how many buyers vs. sellers, etc. 

Data from the website can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce
